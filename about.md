I'm just an average coder who works at [Captricity, an amazing startup based in
Oakland](https://captricity.com). Oftentimes when I learn something, I
immediately forget it as soon as I have exercised the thing I learned. So this
blog is a way to collect my thoughts and learnings so that I can reference it
later. In effect, these are notes for the future me, but I hope these learning
experiences will be useful for others too.
